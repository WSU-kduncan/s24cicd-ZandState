# Documentation Part 1
- Overview
  - What:
    - We are creating a Docker Image using a Dockerfile to set up a container that servers web content using apache2 
  - Why:
    - This is to show that with images and containers there is ease of portability, scalability and allows isolation of processes
  - Tools:
    - Docker Desktop for WSL, Github, Dockerfile (Ubuntu base image, apache2) 
- How To
  - Install docker and dependencies
    - I'm using Windows so I downloaded Docker Desktop online and ran the installer which also downloaded the dependancies and started Docker Desktop to then use in WSL
    - ![docker installed](./images_Project4/docker_v.png)
  - Build an image from the `Dockerfile`
    - Once the dockerfile is created and configured use `docker build -t <name_of_image_here>:<tag> .`
      - The `-t` lets you name the image
      - The `.` specifies PATH which in this case in the context of docker build it located the Dockerfile in my current directory I am in
      - ![docker installed](./images_Project4/dockerfile_configurations.png)
      - ![docker installed](./images_Project4/dockerimagebuild.png)
  - Run the container
    - To run the container use `docker run --name <container_name_here> -d -p 80:80 <image_name_here>:<tag>`
      - The `-d` is detached mode which runs the container in the background
      - The `-p` is portfowarding the host port 80 and mapping it to the container on port 80 so traffic on host port 80 is forwarded to port 80 on the container
      - ![docker installed](./images_Project4/dockerrun.png)
  - View the running container
    - To view the running container you can go to your web browser and type localhost or you can type in the loopback interface ip

# Documentation Part 2
 - Make Docker Hub repo:
   - Log into Docker Hub and click on `Repositories`
   - Click `create repository`
   - Use your account username in namespace and name your repo
   - Add a discription if you want and then choose visibility option (Public or Private)
 - Authenticate to Docker Hub with CLI (Command Line Interface):
   - On the command line do `docker login`
   - Enter your username and password
     - You can type your password in or use your Personal Acess Token (PAT) which is more preferred because of increased security
   - ![docker login](./images_Project4/dockerlogin.png)
 - Push images to Docker Hub w/o using GitHub Actions:
   -  First make sure you are logged in to docker on your CLI
   -  Then you can use `docker push dockerhub_username_here/image_name:tag`
   -  This will push your image to Docker Hub and you will see it in your repositories page
 - [My Docker Hub repo](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/isolat3d)
 - GitHub Secrets:
   - How to set:
     - To set a secret navigate to the `settings` of your repository
     - Click on `Secrets and Variables`
     - Choose `Actions`
     - Then Click the green `New repository secret` button under the Repository Secrets section
   - My Current Secrets:
     - ![git secrets used](./images_Project4/mygitsecret.png)
 - GitHub Workflow:
   - What:
     - The workflow automates the process of logging in, building, and pushing a Docker Image to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions.
   - When:
     - The workflow runner triggers on any push to the main branch per the workflows yml file.
     - ![docker login](./images_Project4/onpushmain.png)
   - Variables:
     - I am using my own custom variables (secrets) for `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` as you can see below in the screenshot.
     - These variables would need to be changed to their own custome secrets if a user is to use the main.yml for there own enviroment and use case.
