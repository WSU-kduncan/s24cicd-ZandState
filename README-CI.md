### Documentation Part 1

- Overview
  - What:
    - We are creating a Docker Image using a Dockerfile to set up a container that servers web content using apache2 
  - Why:
    - This is to show that with images and containers there is ease of portability, scalability and allows isolation of processes
  - Tools:
    - Docker Desktop for WSL, Github, Dockerfile (Ubuntu base image, apache2) 
- How To
  - Install docker and dependencies
    - I'm using Windows so I downloaded Docker Desktop online and ran the installer which also downloaded the dependancies and started Docker Desktop to then use in WSL
  - Building an image from the `Dockerfile`
    - 
  - Running the container
    - 
  - View the running container (open a browser...go to IP and port...)
